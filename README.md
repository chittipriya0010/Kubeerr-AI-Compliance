## Introduction

## Let's Shift Gears: From Web Development to AI-Powered Data Analysis
You've made a significant shift in focus! Instead of building a visually appealing website, you're now aiming to create a powerful application that leverages machine learning to analyze CSV data and provide insights through a conversational interface.

Core Requirements for Your AI-Powered Application
Here's a breakdown of the essential skills and technologies you'll need:

## Python Programming

Core Python: Strong foundation in Python syntax, data structures, and object-oriented programming.
Data Manipulation: Proficiency in libraries like Pandas for data cleaning, exploration, and manipulation.
Machine Learning: Understanding of various algorithms (regression, classification, clustering, etc.) and their applications.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Knowledge for text processing and understanding.

## Machine Learning

Model Selection: Ability to choose appropriate algorithms based on problem type and data characteristics.
Model Training: Experience in training models using relevant libraries like y-DataProfiling.
Model Evaluation: Understanding of metrics to assess model performance.

## Streamlit

App Development: Proficiency in building interactive web applications using Streamlit's declarative syntax.
Component Creation: Ability to create custom components for data visualization and user interaction.
Deployment: Knowledge of deploying Streamlit apps to platforms like Heroku or Streamlit Cloud.

## Additional Considerations

Data Preprocessing: Techniques for handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
Model Deployment: Integrating trained models into the Streamlit application for real-time predictions.
User Interface: Designing an intuitive interface for data upload, model selection, and result visualization.
AI Integration: Incorporating NLP capabilities for conversational interactions with the data.
Potential Application Flow
Data Upload: Allow users to upload CSV files.
Data Profiling: Automatically analyze data structure, quality, and potential issues.
Model Selection: Provide options for different machine learning algorithms based on data type and desired outcome.
Model Training: Train selected models on the uploaded data.
Prediction: Offer a conversational interface where users can ask questions about the data, and the AI provides insights or predictions.
Visualization: Display data visualizations (charts, graphs) to complement the textual responses.
